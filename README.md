sudoku
======

Sudoku puzzle solver in C. Based on the strategy described at
http://norvig.com/sudoku.html but with more optimized data structures.

On my MacBook Pro (Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz, running Mac OS X 10.6.8)
it solves the puzzles in big.txt in 24 s compared to 273 s for the
original Python version (Python 2.7).
